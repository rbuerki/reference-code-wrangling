# Reference Code Wrangling

A repository containing some reference code and projects focused on data wrangling (load, clean, transfrom). 

- folder `extract_load_exmaples` contains short jupyter notebooks focused on loading data from various sources.
- `end to end_Twitter Dogs Udacity.ipynb`contains an end-to-end wrangling project from laoding to analysis.
- `web scraping_1.ipynb` & `webscraping_2.ipynb` contain a little webscraping showcase, first for standard HTML, then for AJAX page.
- The rest of the notebooks are excerpts from larger projects focusing on specific problems.

### Data

The different datasets are all stored in the `data` folder.
