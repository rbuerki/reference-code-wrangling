# Reference Code Wrangling

A repository containing some reference code and projects focused on data wrangling (load, clean, transfrom). 

- the `extract_load_exmaples`folder contains short jupyter notebooks focused on loading data from various sources.
- the `end to end_Twitter Dogs Udacity.ipynb`contains an end-to-end wrangling project from laoding to analysis.
- The rest of the notebooks are excerpts from larger projects that focus on specific problems.

### Data

The different used datasets are all stored in the `data` folder.
